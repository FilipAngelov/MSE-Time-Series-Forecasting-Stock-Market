## Project Intro
The purpose of this project is to develop regression and classification models for stocks trading on the Macedonian Stock Exchange (MSE).
The focus is more on regression models than classification models for purposes explained below.
We use statistical, tradition machine learning, and deep learning models in order to predict stock price 7 days ahead.
The dataset that we have is for 22 stocks trading actively on MSE since 1987 until Aug/25/2020. More on the dataset below.
